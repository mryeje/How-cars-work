      "text": "A fuel system has one main job: supply an engine with fuel. It also helps get the fuel ready so it can burn the right way inside the engine.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a wood stove setup: you need a steady supply of good fuel, delivered smoothly, so the fire burns the way you want.",

        "options": [
          "To cool the engine",

          "To charge the battery"

      "title": "Fuel Tank",
      "page": "??",
      "text": "The fuel tank stores gasoline (or diesel) so the car can run for many miles. The tank must be strong and sealed so fuel does not leak.",
      "analogy": "It’s like a sealed jerry can built into the vehicle.",

        "question": "What does the fuel tank do?",

          "Stores fuel safely",

      "title": "Fuel Pump",
      "page": "??",
      "text": "The fuel pump moves fuel from the tank toward the engine. Many cars use an electric fuel pump to push fuel forward under pressure.",
      "analogy": "Like a small pump that moves water through a hose—except it’s fuel.",

        "question": "What is the fuel pump’s job?",
        "options": [
          "Move fuel toward the engine",

          "Open and close valves"

      "page": "??",
      "text": "A fuel filter removes dirt and particles from fuel before it reaches the engine. Clean fuel helps parts last longer and helps the engine run smoother.",
      "analogy": "Like a water filter that stops grit from getting into a pump.",
      "quiz": {
        "question": "Why do we need a fuel filter?",
        "options": [
          "To remove dirt from fuel",
          "To make the tires spin",
          "To create heat in the engine"
        ],
        "answer": 0,
        "feedback": "Right. It removes dirt and particles before fuel reaches the engine."

      "page": "??",
      "text": "Engines do not burn liquid fuel well by itself. Fuel must mix with air in the right amount. Older systems used a carburetor. Many newer systems use fuel injection.",
      "analogy": "Like starting a campfire: you need fuel and air together, not one without the other.",
      "quiz": {
        "question": "What must fuel mix with to burn properly?",
        "options": [
          "Oil",
