      "text": "Brakes slow down or stop a moving vehicle. They work by creating friction that resists motion. When you press the brake pedal, you are telling the car to turn motion into heat.",
      "analogy": "Brakes are like putting your hand on a spinning wheel. The rubbing slows it down.",

        "question": "What do brakes do?",

      "title": "The Brake Pedal",
      "page": "??",
      "text": "The brake pedal is the driver’s control for the braking system. When you press the pedal, it sends force into the brake system so braking can begin.",
      "analogy": "The pedal is like the handle on a clamp. Your foot pressure controls how tight the clamp squeezes.",

        "question": "What does pressing the brake pedal do?",

          "Locks the steering wheel"

      "id": "c6-hydraulics",
      "title": "Hydraulic Brake System",
      "page": "??",
      "text": "Most cars use a hydraulic brake system. This means brake fluid carries force from the pedal to the wheels. Fluid does not compress easily, so force moves evenly through the system.",
      "analogy": "Like pushing on one end of a filled water hose and seeing pressure move to the other end.",
      "quiz": {
        "question": "Why is brake fluid useful?",
        "options": [
          "It burns fuel",
          "It transfers force evenly",
          "It cools the engine"

      "page": "??",

      "page": "??",

      "page": "??",
      "text": "Disc brakes use brake pads to squeeze a spinning metal disc called a rotor. The friction between the pads and rotor slows the wheel.",
